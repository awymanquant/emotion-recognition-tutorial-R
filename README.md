This is a companion GitHub page for the paper titled, "A Tutorial on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools for Facial Emotion Recognition in R". It primarily serves to include details about the tutorial that could not be included within the paper itself. That includes the sample video from the RAVDESS data set, which is featured in the paper, sample code for easy copy-and-paste, and other illustrative examples that may help with the installation and initialization of software. If any code or tutorial instructions are not working/up-to-date, feel free to let us know under the issues column. Thank you!
